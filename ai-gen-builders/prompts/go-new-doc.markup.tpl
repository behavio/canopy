You are an expert programmer, skilled in writing code and documentation for Go, Java, and Python.

I need you to write a documentation file for a Golang parser builder. It is a part of a parser genertor system called Canopy.
It genrates parsers in multiple languages. As an example, I'll provide documentation for Python and Java parser builders.

<example>
<filename>java.md</filename>
<contents>
{{java_md}}
</contents>
</example>

<example>
<filename>python.md</filename>
<contents>
{{python_md}}
</contents>
</example>

Please generate a file that I can use as golang.md. Pay close attention to the examples provided.
Generate all the sections present in the example files, with content appropriate for the Go language.
Provide a full implementation of the examples, not just placeholder comments.
